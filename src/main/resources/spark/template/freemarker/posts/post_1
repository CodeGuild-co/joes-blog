                <h3>First blog post!</h3>
                <p>Arrived today and the whole setup of the place is very well done and it has given me confidence that the week is going to be successful for me. It looks like itâ€™s going to give me confidence and hopefully build up my team work skills and definitely help me learn a new language and the framework with it. The idea of starting a blog to keep going into the future to help me remember things will definitely be a useful one if I can continue using it and not forget about it. The main learning from today is that no matter how scary something is looking like it is going to be, if you get stuck in to it and hope for the best it is going to turn out good.</p>
